## Design Style Guide (`DESIGN.md`)

`DESIGN.md` at the project root is the app's durable design brief: the aesthetic
direction, color palette, font pairing, spacing/radius conventions, and animation
utilities. `src/client/index.css` (Tailwind configured CSS-first via the `@theme`
directive) is where those decisions live as code. Read `DESIGN.md` before any UI
work, and whenever you make or change a design decision, update it to match so
the brief always reflects the real design.

**If `DESIGN.md` is still the starter placeholder (marked `STATUS: NOT
ESTABLISHED`), the app has no design identity yet.** Before implementing any
functionality, you MUST establish a unique design identity for this app:

1. **Choose a distinctive aesthetic direction** based on the app's purpose and
   audience. Consider the tone: is it playful, professional, editorial,
   minimalist, bold, warm, technical, luxurious? Each app should feel different.
2. **Create a style guide** by updating `src/client/index.css` with:
   - A custom color palette defined as `@theme` tokens (avoid generic blue/gray
     — pick colors that match the app's personality)
   - A distinctive font pairing imported from Google Fonts (one display/heading
     font + one body font — avoid Inter, Roboto, Arial)
   - A spacing and border-radius convention that fits the aesthetic
   - Smooth transitions and animations: define reusable animation keyframes and
     `@theme` `--animate-*` utilities (e.g. fade-in, slide-up, staggered
     reveals) for consistent motion across the app
3. **Rewrite `DESIGN.md`** with the actual design brief, replacing the
   placeholder contents entirely (including the `STATUS: NOT ESTABLISHED`
   block): the aesthetic direction and rationale, the color palette (token
   names + values), the font pairing, spacing/radius conventions, and the
   animation utilities. This marks the design identity as established.
4. **Replace the starter template completely — every starter surface, not just
   the home page.** The default HomePage, the shared `Page` wrapper and its
   header/nav, and the Login and Signup pages are all generic placeholders.
   Restyle ALL of them to your chosen aesthetic in this first build — a common
   failure is theming only HomePage and leaving the shared wrapper and auth
   pages on the old generic gray/black template, which makes the app feel
   half-finished. Build the UI from scratch; do not inherit styles or layout
   patterns from the template. If a starter surface exists that isn't listed
   here, restyle it too.

Do this as your first step, before writing any feature code. `DESIGN.md` and the
updated `src/client/index.css` must be part of the same turn's changes so they
are committed together. All subsequent UI work must follow this style guide.

## QUORUM — product state (READ FIRST)

QUORUM is an AI-native **decision-governance engine** for crypto & digital
assets. It is ONE shared engine with five business-line modules attached, not
five apps. Canonical pipeline (identical for every module — only inputs and
module-specific risk checks differ):

`OBSERVATION → AGENT THESIS → DEBATE → RECONCILIATION → VALIDATION → RISK GATE
→ (PAPER/SHADOW →) HUMAN APPROVAL → ACTION → AUDIT RECORD`

Business lines: Trading, Private Equity (pre-launch/TGE), Private Credit
(on-chain lending), Investment Banking (advisory), AUM (allocator reporting).

### Non-negotiable product rules
- Never present seeded/demo data as live. Every stored row carries `dataOrigin`
  (`seed | simulated | ingested | manual`) and the UI renders that tag.
- Agent consensus never bypasses validation; validation never bypasses the risk gate.
- No module implements its own risk or audit logic — always the shared engine.
- Regulatory/jurisdiction facts are **versioned assertions** (`effectiveFrom`/
  `effectiveTo`, `source`, `sourceTimestamp`), never hard-coded permanent truths.
- Tier and gate by token category + jurisdiction; crypto is not one asset class.
- Everything defaults to PAPER/SHADOW until a human explicitly promotes it.
- Human overrides are preserved permanently in the audit trail.

### Build progress (slices)
- **Slice 1 — Registry: DONE.** `src/server/core/registry/` (`db.ts`, `seed.ts`,
  `index.ts`), module `registry` registered in `src/server/app.ts`; migration
  v2 seeds reference data. Stores: `registryChains`, `registryVenues`,
  `registryTokens`, `registryJurisdictions`, `registryRegulatoryFacts`
  (versioned assertions). Queries: `registry.overview`, `listChains`,
  `listVenues`, `listJurisdictions`, `listTokens`, `regulatoryFacts`.
  UI: `/` = Registry console (`pages/HomePage.tsx`), app shell in
  `components/Page.tsx` (sidebar lists later stages as inert `SOON` items).
  Data is 100% SEED — no ingestion source connected.
- **Slice 2 — Evidence layer: DONE.** `src/server/core/evidence/`:
  - `db.ts` — `coreObservations` (observationKey unique, sourceType, source,
    observedAt, retrievalTimestamp, verifiability, relevantEntity*, metric,
    value, unit, statement, jobRunId, generatorVersion, dataOrigin) and
    `coreJobRuns` (append-only ledger; `(jobId, runKey)` unique).
  - `generators.ts` — DETERMINISTIC synthetic feeds for the 5 source types
    (on_chain, market_microstructure, narrative_social, regulatory, security).
    Output is a pure function of `(runKey, entity, metric)` via FNV-1a + PRNG, so
    replays are byte-identical. `GENERATOR_VERSION` stamped on every row.
    **Replacing a real feed = replacing this file only.** Tier profiles make
    fresh-launch/micro-cap readings genuinely adverse.
  - `ingest.ts` — `runIngestion()` is the ONLY write path. Opens a job-run row,
    inserts observations keyed `jobId:runKey:entityId:metric`, treats E11000 as
    `skipped`, always closes the row (even on crash). An already-recorded run key
    returns `status: 'skipped'` — replay never forks or overwrites history.
  - `index.ts` — module `evidence`: queries `overview`, `feed`, `jobRuns`;
    mutations `runCycle` (manual cycle across all 5 sources), `replayRun`
    (determinism proof); 5 cron jobs, cadence = idempotency bucket width
    (micro 5m, on-chain 15m, narrative 30m, security 1h, regulatory 6h).
  - UI: `/evidence` (`pages/EvidencePage.tsx`), nav item wired in `Page.tsx`.
  - Data is 100% `simulated` — sources prefixed `synthetic:`, page shows a
    "SIMULATED EVIDENCE — NOT LIVE" banner while `provenance.ingested === 0`.
  - `verifiability` is load-bearing: KOL posts stored as `social_claim`,
    classification chatter as `inferred` and NEVER auto-applied to the registry.
- **Slice 3 — Agent swarm: DONE.** `src/server/core/agents/`:
  - `db.ts` — `coreAgents` (roster rows: mandate, sourceScope, metricScope,
    `maxConfidence` ceiling, enabled flag) and `coreTheses` (immutable; stance,
    confidence + `confidenceCap`/`confidenceCapReason`, rationale,
    `falsifiableCondition`, `weakestLink`, `citedObservationKeys`,
    `evidenceGaps`, `weakestVerifiability`, `evidenceOrigins`, evidence window,
    `status: ACTIVE|SUPERSEDED`). Reconciliation supersedes, never edits.
  - `roster.ts` — the 8 core agents, RULE-BASED and deterministic (no LLM, no
    randomness): flow-analyst, liquidity-analyst, volume-integrity,
    narrative-analyst (ceiling 45 — attention is never fundamentals),
    regulatory-analyst, security-analyst, structure-analyst, red-team
    (ceiling 70 so pessimism can't dominate on confidence).
    `AGENT_GENERATOR_VERSION` must be bumped on any reasoning change.
  - `run.ts` — `runThesisCycle()` on the shared `coreJobRuns` ledger
    (`jobId: 'agents.thesis'`). Engine rules applied ON TOP of agent output in
    `runAgent()`: **no citations ⇒ forced ABSTAIN at 0**; confidence clamped by
    agent ceiling AND by weakest cited verifiability (social_claim/unverified
    cap 40); thin-citation cap of 45 — **exempt for BLOCK_RECOMMENDED
    (asymmetric evidence burden: refusing to act needs less evidence than
    acting)**. Bounded by explicit `asOf` so a thesis is always formed over the
    evidence visible at that moment.
  - `seed.ts` + migration v3 — upserts the roster; `$setOnInsert` protects the
    operator `enabled` flag from being clobbered on re-seed.
  - `index.ts` — module `agents`: queries `overview`, `roster`, `theses`,
    `thesisEvidence` (provenance walk thesis → observation → job run, and
    reports `unresolvedCitations` which must always be 0); mutations `runCycle`,
    `replayCycle`, `setAgentEnabled`; 30m cron.
  - UI: `/agents` (`pages/AgentsPage.tsx`) — expandable thesis cards showing
    citations, gaps, cap reason and falsifiable condition; roster tab.
  - Theses inherit provenance: `dataOrigin` is `ingested` only if cited evidence
    is; otherwise `simulated`. A thesis can never be more live than its evidence.
- **Slice 4 — Debate engine: DONE.** `src/server/core/debate/`:
  - `db.ts` — `coreDebates`, `coreDebateParticipants`, `coreThesisChallenges`,
    `coreDebateRounds`, `coreDebateOutcomes`. All append-only.
  - `engine.ts` — `DEBATE_ENGINE_VERSION`. `generateChallenges()` (agents may
    only attack from their OWN mandate: 6 challenge types), `adjudicate()`
    (every ruling names a rule — HARD_BLOCKER_PRECEDENCE,
    CLAIM_CANNOT_CARRY_DIRECTION, DIRECTIONAL_WITHOUT_EXIT_PATH,
    NON_ECONOMIC_VOLUME_INVALIDATES_MOMENTUM, THIN_EVIDENCE_UNDER_SELF_DECLARED_RISK,
    MATERIAL_EVIDENCE_GAPS, IMMATERIAL_GAP, DECLARED_RISK_IS_NOT_DEFEAT,
    DEFENDER_PRICED_LIQUIDITY; burden is on the challenger), `resolve()`.
  - **CONFIDENCE IS NEVER AVERAGED AND VOTES ARE NEVER COUNTED.** The outcome
    carries ONE surviving thesis's own confidence via `convictionSource`, with
    `convictionFloor` reported alongside. Bulls vs bears both surviving ⇒
    `CONTESTED`, never a split-the-difference number. A surviving
    BLOCK_RECOMMENDED ends the debate (`BLOCKED_BY_DEBATE`) regardless of how
    many agents were bullish.
  - Dissent is preserved permanently for ALL participants, including defeated
    ones (`dissent[]` + `survived` on participants). Losing an argument does not
    erase it.
  - Every outcome stores `requiresValidation: true` — a debate outcome
    authorises nothing. Consensus must still pass Slice 5 validation and the
    Slice 6 risk gate.
  - `run.ts` — `runDebateCycle()` on the shared ledger (`jobId:
    'debate.reconcile'`, `runKey = debate:<thesisRunKey>`), one debate per
    subject per thesis run, 3 rounds (OPENING / CHALLENGE / RECONCILIATION).
  - `index.ts` — module `debate`: queries `overview`, `outcomes`, `transcript`;
    mutation `runCycle`; 30m cron. UI: `/debate` (`pages/DebatePage.tsx`).
- **Slice 5 — Validation engine: DONE.** `src/server/core/validation/`:
  - `db.ts` — `coreStrategies` (lifecycle DISCOVERED → UNDER_TEST →
    FAILED|PASSED → PAPER → SHADOW → PRODUCTION → RETIRED), `coreValidationRuns`,
    `coreValidationTests`, `coreStrategyTransitions` (append-only lifecycle
    ledger). `AUTOMATED_TRANSITIONS` is the machine-readable statement of what
    the engine may do alone — SHADOW/PRODUCTION are absent from it on purpose.
  - `harness.ts` — six tests: SURVIVORSHIP_CORRECTED_BACKTEST, WALK_FORWARD,
    REGIME_DECOMPOSITION, SLIPPAGE_ON_REAL_DEPTH, WASH_ADJUSTED_VOLUME,
    ADVERSARIAL_RED_TEAM. **The last three read real observations from the
    evidence layer; the first three derive a deterministic synthetic track
    record because no price history is connected.** That split is labelled on
    every test row and in the UI. Do NOT silently blend the two.
  - `verdictFor()` — **tests are never scored or averaged.** Strict precedence:
    any FAIL ⇒ FAILED (`ANY_FAILED_TEST_FAILS_THE_STRATEGY`); any INCONCLUSIVE ⇒
    HELD at UNDER_TEST (`INCONCLUSIVE_IS_NOT_A_PASS`); only a clean sweep passes.
    Missing evidence is treated as unusable, never as clean.
  - `run.ts` — `runValidationCycle()` on the shared ledger (`jobId:
    'validation.cycle'`, `runKey = validate:<debateRunKey>`). Phase 1 promotes
    ONLY `DIRECTIONAL_CONSENSUS` + BULLISH/BEARISH debate outcomes into
    candidates — blocked/contested debates produce nothing. Phase 2 tests every
    DISCOVERED/UNDER_TEST candidate. `transition()` is the single guard for all
    lifecycle moves and throws if the engine attempts a human-only one.
  - PASSED auto-promotes to PAPER and stops there. `validation.promoteStrategy`
    is the only path past PAPER, requires auth, records the userId permanently,
    and refuses stage-skipping.
  - `index.ts` — module `validation`: queries `overview`, `strategies`,
    `dossier`; mutations `runCycle`, `promoteStrategy`; 30m cron.
    UI: `/validation` (`pages/ValidationPage.tsx`).
  - Known gap: FAILED is terminal. Re-examining a failed idea requires a fresh
    debate producing a new candidate — deliberate, so a strategy can't be
    quietly re-run until it passes.
- **Slice 6 — Risk gate: DONE.** `src/server/core/risk/`:
  - `db.ts` — `coreRiskPolicies` (versioned mirror of the in-code ruleset),
    `coreRiskAssessments`, `coreRiskFindings`, `coreRiskOverrides` (append-only,
    permanent). `mostRestrictive()` + `VERDICT_SEVERITY` implement the
    combination rule: **findings are never scored or averaged**, the harshest
    verdict wins and the rule that produced it is named as `decisiveRuleId`.
  - `rules.ts` — nine rules, `RISK_ENGINE_VERSION = 'risk-gate@1.0.0'`:
    VALIDATION_PREREQUISITE, JUR_PRE_APPROVAL_REQUIRED (Nigeria-style per-token
    SEC pre-approval; meme coins are NOT exempt), TIER3_UNCLASSIFIED_UNLOCKED_LP
    (hard BLOCK, not a soft warning), CAPITAL_ORIGIN_VENUE_MISMATCH (SA exchange
    control — reads `capitalOriginJurisdictionId` separately from the liquidity
    venue), CONTRACT_SECURITY_POSTURE, HOLDER_CONCENTRATION,
    EXIT_DEPTH_SUFFICIENCY, TIER_POSITION_CEILING ($500k/$100k/$15k by tier),
    EXECUTION_MODE_CEILING. Each rule declares `overridable`; the four hard
    blocks are not.
  - `run.ts` — `runGateCycle()` on the shared ledger (`jobId: 'risk.gate'`,
    `runKey = gate:<validationRunKey>`). `syncPolicies()` mirrors the ruleset
    into the policy store with `$setOnInsert` so `effectiveFrom` is never
    rewritten. Every assessment stamps `policyKeys[]` so a decision replays
    rule-for-rule against the versions actually in force.
  - **Validation is re-checked as a rule inside the gate, not assumed by the
    caller** — consensus cannot route around it.
  - `index.ts` — module `risk`: queries `overview`, `policies`, `assessments`,
    `findings`; mutations `runCycle`, `overrideAssessment`, `syncPolicies`; 30m
    cron. UI: `/risk` (`pages/RiskGatePage.tsx`).
  - `overrideAssessment` requires auth + a ≥20-char reason, writes a NEW
    permanent record (the original assessment is never edited), and **refuses to
    release a BLOCKED assessment** — clearing a hard block requires changing the
    rule or the fact, both versioned.
- Slices 7–15 (paper/shadow execution, the five business-line modules, command
  center, provenance/audit console, job orchestration): NOT BUILT.

Key registry conventions: `tierForCategory()` derives Tier 1/2/3 from token
category; tokens store `capitalOriginJurisdictionId` separately from
`liquidityVenueJurisdictionId` (SA exchange control); Nigeria pre-approval is a
jurisdiction rule (`requiresPreApproval`), not a token special case.

### 2. AVAILABLE UI COMPONENTS (SHADCN-STYLE, ON BASE UI)

Located in `/user-app/src/client/components/ui/`. Interactive primitives wrap
**Base UI** (`@base-ui/react`, unstyled, accessible — keyboard nav, focus
management, Esc/Space/arrow handling come for free). Style is applied via
Tailwind + `data-*` state attributes. Plain controls (Button, Input, etc.) are
styled native elements. **No barrel index** — import each from its own file.

#### Design tokens — single source of truth (`ui/_shared/`)
Edit these to retune the whole library; every control reads from them.
- **`sizes.ts`** — control sizes `sm | md | lg`. `SIZES` (text controls),
  `ICON_SIZES` (square icon controls), `ICON_GLYPH` (inline icon px). Heights
  are shared (`sm=h-8 / md=h-9 / lg=h-10`) so an `sm` Button lines up with an
  `sm` Input/Select/IconButton. **Keep `h-*` in sync between the two maps.**
- **`variants.ts`** — `variant` (style: `solid | outline | ghost | link | soft`)
  × `color` (intent: `neutral | primary | destructive`). `solid`+`neutral` is
  the default black button. `CONTROL_BASE` holds shared base + focus ring +
  `cursor-pointer`.
- **`buttonGroup.ts`** — context for ButtonGroup → child size/variant/color.

#### Buttons
- **`Button.tsx`** — `variant`, `color`, `size`, `loading`, `leftIcon`,
  `rightIcon`, `render` (polymorphism via Base UI `useRender` — replaces the old
  `asChild`). No `size="icon"` (use IconButton). Migration from old API:
  `default`→solid/neutral · `destructive`→solid+destructive ·
  `secondary`→soft+neutral · `outline`/`ghost`/`link`→same `variant`.
- **`IconButton.tsx`** — square icon-only button, same `sm/md/lg` heights and
  `variant`×`color` as Button. **`aria-label` is required** (enforced by types).
- **`ButtonGroup.tsx`** — segmented group that fuses inner radii/borders. Holds
  Button/IconButton **and** form controls (Input, Textarea, Select trigger) as
  siblings, e.g. an Input with attached buttons (matches shadcn's ButtonGroup).
  Props `orientation` (`horizontal`|`vertical`), `size`, `variant`, `color`
  (propagated to child Button/IconButton; a child's own prop wins).

#### Form controls (sizes align with Button)
- **`Input.tsx`** — `size?: ControlSize`. (Native numeric `size` is omitted.)
- **`Textarea.tsx`** — multi-line, `min-h-16`.
- **`Label.tsx`** — shadcn-style: `flex items-center gap-2`, peer/group-disabled.
- **`Checkbox.tsx`** — Base UI; Space toggles; supports `indeterminate`.
- **`Switch.tsx`** — Base UI toggle.
- **`RadioGroup.tsx`** — `RadioGroup` + `RadioGroupItem`; arrow-key roving focus.
- **`Select.tsx`** — single component: `<Select options={[{label,value,disabled}]}
  value onValueChange placeholder size />`. Shows the selected option's label in
  the closed trigger (via Base UI `items`). Optional `renderItem` for custom rows.

#### Overlays & navigation
- **`Dialog.tsx`** — `Dialog`, `DialogTrigger`, `DialogContent` (Esc-closes,
  focus-trapped, built-in close button), `DialogTitle`, `DialogDescription`,
  `DialogHeader`, `DialogFooter`, `DialogClose`.
- **`DropdownMenu.tsx`** — `DropdownMenu`, `DropdownMenuTrigger`,
  `DropdownMenuContent`, `DropdownMenuItem`, `DropdownMenuLabel` (standalone,
  use anywhere), `DropdownMenuSeparator`, `DropdownMenuGroup` +
  `DropdownMenuGroupLabel` (the label MUST be inside a Group).
- **`Tabs.tsx`** — `Tabs`, `TabsList`, `TabsTab`, `TabsPanel`.
- **`Tooltip.tsx`** — `Tooltip`, `TooltipTrigger`, `TooltipContent`. Requires
  **`TooltipProvider`**, already mounted once at the app root in `index.tsx`.

#### Display
- **`Card.tsx`** — `Card`, `CardHeader`, `CardTitle`, `CardDescription`,
  `CardAction` (top-right header slot), `CardContent`, `CardFooter`.
- **`Badge.tsx`** — `variant` (`solid|soft|outline`) × `color`.
- **`Avatar.tsx`** — `Avatar`, `AvatarImage`, `AvatarFallback`.
- **`Separator.tsx`** — `orientation` (`horizontal`|`vertical`).
- **`Spinner.tsx`** — inline spinner glyph (use inside controls). For page-level
  loading use `components/LoadingSpinner` (which renders a `Spinner`).

All components use the `cn()` utility for class merging. New interactive
primitives are client components (`"use client"`). The app root sets
`isolation: isolate` (in `index.css`) so portalled popups stack correctly.

### 3. UTILITY FUNCTIONS

**File**: `/user-app/src/client/lib/utils.ts`

```typescript
export function cn(...inputs: ClassValue[]) {
  return twMerge(clsx(inputs))
}
```
- Uses `clsx` for conditional classes
- Uses `tailwind-merge` to prevent class conflicts
- Perfect for merging component classes with custom overrides

### 4. EXISTING FORM PATTERNS

The app already has two working form examples you can reference:

#### LoginForm (`/user-app/src/client/pages/LoginPage.tsx`)
- Email and password fields
- `FormData` API for form submission
- Card-based layout with headers and footers
- Validation and error handling
- Links to signup

#### SignupForm (`/user-app/src/client/pages/SignupPage.tsx`)
- Email, password, confirm password
- Checkbox for terms acceptance
- Success state handling
- Client-side password validation
- Toast error notifications
- `useCallback` hook for form submission
- State management for success state

### 5. APP STRUCTURE & ARCHITECTURE

#### Client Setup (`/user-app/src/client/index.tsx`)
```typescript
- React Query (TanStack) integration
- React Router DOM
- React Hot Toast for notifications
- Suspense boundaries with loading state
- Global error handler
```

#### Router Configuration (`/user-app/src/client/router.tsx`)
- **Public Routes**: Home, Example, Terms, Logout, 404
- **Guest Routes**: Login, Signup (redirects to home if authenticated)
- **Private Routes**: PrivateExamplePage (redirects to login if not authenticated)
- **Route Protection**: 
  - `GuestRoute` component for auth-only pages
  - `PrivateRoute` component for protected pages
  - Redirect with `_redirect` query param to return after login

#### Page Wrapper (`/user-app/src/client/components/Page.tsx`)
- Header with a Home button (left) and either user handle + Logout or a Sign in button (right) — no logo
- Responsive layout with max-width
- Body section with optional loading state
- Accepts a `seo` prop (`{ title?, noindex? }`) that is forwarded to `<Seo />`
  to set the document `<title>` per page (see SEO/TITLE PATTERN below)

### 6. MODULE SYSTEM (Backend)

**File**: `/user-app/src/server/example/index.ts`

Example shows Module pattern with:

```typescript
new Module('example', {
  configSchema: { /* configuration */ },
  stores: [ /* database stores */ ],
  queries: {
    getItem: async (args, { user }) => { /* query logic */ },
    getItems: async (args, { user }) => { /* query logic */ }
  },
  mutations: {
    createItem: async (args, { user }) => { /* mutation logic */ },
    updateItem: async (args, { user }) => { /* mutation logic */ }
  },
  cronJobs: {
    dailyTest: dailyTestCron
  }
})
```

#### Database Pattern (`/user-app/src/server/example/db.ts`)
```typescript
export const dbExampleItems = new Store('exampleItems', {
  schema: {
    title: schema.string(),
    createdAt: schema.date(),
    userId: schema.userId(),
  },
  indexes: []
});
```

### 7. BUILD & DEVELOPMENT

**Scripts** (from package.json):
```bash
npm run dev          # Development server
npm run build        # Production build
npm start            # Start production server
npm test             # Run tests (not configured)
```

**Vite Configuration**:
- Root: `src/client`
- Path alias: `@/` → `./src/`
- Dev server: `0.0.0.0:5173` (allows external access)
- React plugin enabled

### 8. STYLING SETUP

- **Tailwind CSS v4** via the `@tailwindcss/vite` plugin. All Tailwind config
  is CSS-first in `src/client/index.css` (`@import "tailwindcss"`, `@theme`,
  `@source`, etc.) — customize the design system there.
- **Color Scheme**: Gray, black, white primary colors; blue, red accents —
  starter defaults only, meant to be replaced when the design identity is
  established (see "Design Style Guide (`DESIGN.md`)" at the top of this file).

### 9. SEO (TITLE, DESCRIPTION, OG TAGS)

- `src/client/seo.config.ts` is the single source of truth for `siteName` and
  the site-wide meta `description`. **You MUST update both fields** as soon as
  the product name is known — they default to the literal string
  `"Empty Project"` and a generic placeholder description, both of which ship
  broken SEO and social previews. Update them on any landing-page task or
  product-rename request.
- `<Seo />` (in `src/client/components/Seo.tsx`) renders `<title>`, the meta
  description, and Open Graph / Twitter card tags from `seoConfig`. It is
  already mounted once at the app root in `src/client/index.tsx`, so every
  page inherits the site-wide defaults automatically.
- Per-page overrides: pass `seo` to `<Page />`, e.g.
  `<Page seo={{ title: 'Sign in' }}>` or
  `<Page seo={{ title: 'Pricing', description: '...' }}>`. Set
  `noindex: true` for auth, terms, and 404 pages.
- Rendered at runtime via React 19 native `<title>` / `<meta>` hoisting; no
  SEO library needed.
- Heading hierarchy: every page must have exactly one `<h1>` and headings
  must descend monotonically (`h1 → h2 → h3`, never skip a level). Skipped
  levels hurt accessibility audits and SEO.

### 10. REUSABLE PATTERNS FOR NEW FEATURES

When adding a new feature, reach for these existing building blocks before
introducing new ones:

1. **Forms**: native `FormData` API, mirroring `LoginPage` / `SignupPage`.
2. **Validation**: Zod on the server (inside module queries/mutations);
   lightweight client-side checks before submit.
3. **UI Components**: the full set in `src/client/components/ui/` (Button,
   IconButton, ButtonGroup, Input, Textarea, Label, Checkbox, Switch,
   RadioGroup, Select, Dialog, DropdownMenu, Tabs, Tooltip, Card, Badge,
   Avatar, Separator, Spinner). See section 2. Interactive primitives are built
   on `@base-ui/react`; reuse these before adding any external UI library.
4. **Page Layout**: wrap routes in `<Page>` (sets header + `<title>` via
   the `seo` prop).
5. **Icons**: `lucide-react`.
6. **Toast Notifications**: `react-hot-toast` for user feedback.
7. **Server State**: `@tanstack/react-query` via `@modelence/react-query`
   helpers (`useQuery`, `useMutation`).
8. **Local State**: standard React hooks (`useState`, `useCallback`,
   `useMemo`, `useRef`). On React 19, prefer ref-as-prop over `forwardRef`
   in any new components.
9. **Styling**: Tailwind classes combined with the `cn()` helper from
   `src/client/lib/utils.ts`.
10. **Backend feature**: add a new `Module` under `src/server/<feature>/`
    following the `example` module shape (`configSchema`, `stores`,
    `queries`, `mutations`, optional `cronJobs`), and register it in
    `src/server/app.ts`.

### Summary

This is a full-stack Modelence framework application with:
- Clean component structure ready for new features
- All necessary UI building blocks already available
- Form handling patterns established
- Database and backend module patterns ready to follow
- Authentication system in place
- TypeScript support throughout
- A shadcn-style component library built on `@base-ui/react` (accessible
  primitives) is already implemented — reuse it before adding any UI library

### 11. MOBILE APP (Expo, optional)

A project may *optionally* include a mobile app alongside the web app. The
template ships an empty `mobile/` folder, but the studio treats the mobile
app as "not yet created" until the marker file
`mobile/.modelence-mobile-enabled` exists. The Mobile tab in the studio shows
a "Create mobile app" CTA in this state.

**Folder layout**

```
project-root/
├── src/server/        # Modelence backend (unchanged)
├── src/client/        # Web client (unchanged)
├── package.json       # Web dependencies (+ postinstall for mobile)
└── mobile/            # Expo / React Native app (shipped but unhooked)
    ├── .modelence-mobile-enabled  # marker file — present once created
    ├── package.json   # Expo's deps (main: "expo-router/entry")
    ├── app.config.js  # Expo config (includes scheme for deep linking)
    ├── index.ts       # configureClient + auth token persistence (side-effect module)

    │   │   ├── _layout.tsx      # headerless Stack for unauthenticated screens
    │   │   └── sign-in.tsx      # sign-in screen
    │   └── (app)/
    │       ├── _layout.tsx      # headerless Stack for authenticated screens
    │       └── home.tsx         # home screen (requires auth)
    ├── components/    # React Native UI library (RN equivalents of src/client/components/ui)
    │   ├── LoadingSpinner.tsx   # screen-level loading state
    │   └── ui/                  # Button, Input, Card, Dialog, … + _shared/ design tokens
    ├── babel.config.js
    └── tsconfig.json
```

**Important rules**

- The studio's "Create mobile app" flow (button or matching free-text prompt)
  scaffolds/installs the Expo app and writes `mobile/.modelence-mobile-enabled`.
  Do NOT write that marker without first installing Expo dependencies — the
  studio assumes mobile is fully usable once the marker is present.
- The mobile app uses **Expo Router 4.x** (file-based routing). The entry
  point is `expo-router/entry` (set in `mobile/package.json`'s `"main"` field).
  Route groups: `(auth)` for unauthenticated screens, `(app)` for protected
  screens. The `RouteGuard` component in `app/_layout.tsx` redirects based on
  `useSession()` — unauthenticated → `/(auth)/sign-in`, authenticated →
  `/(app)/home`. Do not revert to a manual `registerRootComponent` + `App.tsx`
  setup.
- `index.ts` is a side-effect module (imported by `app/_layout.tsx`) that runs
  `configureClient` and rehydrates the auth token from AsyncStorage. It does
  NOT call `registerRootComponent`.
- **Mobile UI components** live in `mobile/components/ui/` — React Native
  equivalents of the web set in `src/client/components/ui/`, with a parallel
  prop API so the two platforms read as one design system. The full set:
  Button, IconButton, ButtonGroup, Spinner, Input, Textarea, Label, Checkbox,
  Switch, RadioGroup, Select, Tabs, Card, Badge, Avatar, Separator, Dialog,
  DropdownMenu, Tooltip (import from the `mobile/components/ui` barrel). Reuse
  these before adding any external RN UI library. Key differences from web,
  since RN has no Tailwind/Base UI/DOM:
  - Styling is plain `StyleSheet` (no Tailwind/NativeWind). Shared design tokens
    (palette, sizes, variants) live in `mobile/components/ui/_shared/` and mirror
    the web tokens — edit tokens there, not per-component, to restyle globally.
  - There is no `:hover`/`:active`; variant styles model rest + pressed states.
  - Overlays use native primitives: `Select`, `DropdownMenu` present a Modal
    (bottom sheet / action sheet); `Dialog` is a centered Modal; `Tooltip`
    reveals on tap (and hover on web) rather than hover-only. `TooltipProvider`
    is a no-op passthrough kept for API parity.
  - `DropdownMenuTrigger` / `DialogTrigger` / `DialogClose` clone their single
    child and inject `onPress` — pass exactly one pressable element as the child.
- Keep `mobile/`'s `package.json` and `node_modules` separate from the web
  app's. Metro and Vite cannot share the same dependency tree.
- The Studio sandbox runs `expo start --tunnel` automatically when the user
  opens the Mobile preview tab. **Do not** add a long-running Expo process
  to the root `package.json`'s `dev` script.
- The root `package.json` has a `postinstall` that runs
  `node scripts/postinstall.mjs`. That script re-installs mobile deps whenever
  the marker exists and no-ops otherwise. Do not remove either; do not change
  the script to run unconditionally.
- Optional convenience scripts you may add at the project root:
  `"dev:mobile": "cd mobile && npm run start"`.
- API calls from the mobile app to the Modelence backend should target the
  sandbox URL exposed in the studio preview (set via an env var the user
  configures in `mobile/app.json`'s `extra` field).
- When adding shared logic, prefer plain TypeScript modules under
  `src/shared/` and import them from both the web client and the mobile app's
  `app/` screens. Avoid React-DOM-only or Node-only imports in shared code.
